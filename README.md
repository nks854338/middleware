# Express.js Middleware Demo with CORS and Body-Parser

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use middleware in an Express.js application, specifically focusing on CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and body-parser. It includes a frontend form that sends data to the backend, which uses CORS and body-parser to handle requests and responses.
